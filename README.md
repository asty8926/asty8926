:wave: **Hi, I'm Asty'** and I enjoy learning, turning ideas into reality, helping people, and solving problems.


I'm also very interested about tools that ease and improve life as a whole, whether for productivity, comfort, or speed.

I either **hunt such tools or make them myself**. Some utility tools can be found in my [Repositories Section](https://github.com/asty8926?tab=repositories).

#### Some technologies and tools I'm super happy about:
![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=svelte,tailwind,firebase,github,figma,md,js)

[Svelte(Kit)](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) altogether have been a blast to work with for Full-Stack Web Development. ðŸ‘Œ

That combined with [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com) for Wireframing and Brainstorming, and [Figma](https://figma.com) for UI/UX prototypes beforehand and the experience is amazing.
